# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Model-using-Deep-Learning-
•Built a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Flask, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for live video monitoring, incorporating Haar cascades for face and eye detection.<br/> •Implemented an alert system with audio-visual warnings when drowsiness is detected, leveraging a pre-trained model for eye state classification.
